    (This is a continutation of problem 3B, since my latex broke for some reason).\\

    The last equality follows because $Pr[Enc(K_2, m) = c_2] = \mathcal{D}(c_2)$ by OTS.\\

    Thus, the distribution of $(C_1, C_2)$ is the product distribution $D \times D$ which does not depend on the msg $m$. Consequently, this means that for any two msgs $m_0, m_1 \in M$, the distributions of $Enc_{new}((K_1, K_2), m_0)$ and $Enc_{new}((K_1, K_2), m_1)$ are identical. This proves that $Enc_{new}$ has OTS.
